It is a basic django web app.
### The things that you can add
1) The data of flights and hotels is static . We can use an API for data of both.
2) The web app is not much user-friendly UI-wise you can make it more user-friendly.
3) You can do better with the frontend.
4) If a hotel or flight is full while in the package section we can still book it . You can tackle that issue.
